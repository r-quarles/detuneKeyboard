DETUNE TUNING KEYBOARD - Rae Quarles - Dec 2024

Running the program ---
- This github page can be accessed via the link: https://r-quarles.github.io/detuneKeyboard/
- To run the program locally:
  - Download the zipped file from github.com/r-quarles
  - Unzip and open the main folder in VS Code
  - Open the sketch.js file and the index.html file
  - Open Live Server by searching in the Command Pallette or using shortcut Alt+L for LiveServer then Alt+O for Open
  - OR - 
  - Open the .p5 web editor at https://editor.p5js.org/
  - Copy and paste the .js code into the editor, and press run (you do not need to add any libraries)
- To run prototype Processing version:
  - Download Processing IDE and Supercollider to your machine
  - Open the .sc file in Supercollider
  - Start the Supercollider server by running line 8 s.boot; (select line and press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter to run, Ctrl/Cmd + . to stop)
  - Select and run line 11 to find your local IP4 address, look for this in the command prompt and find the NetAddr(server, port)
    - Mine looks like this: (127.0.0.1, 57120)
  - Open .pde file in the Processing application
  - Find line 60 and confirm your NetAddr matches what is listed in myAdress (if not, type it manually in the form "server", port)
  - Start the synth and receiver in Supercollider by selecting and running lines 27 and 51
  - Run the code in Processing using the "play" button

CONCEPT - 
This project is a combination of two purposes: to create a visual and interactive tool for exploring different musical tuning temperments, and to further expand upon my
knowledge and experience with musical interface design. 


DESIGN PROCESS -

Articulate your concept and creative design process. Discuss and evaluate how existing digital
or electronic music instruments have addressed interactive musical interfaces like yours. What
are the additional features or interesting combination of features you have created (or would like
to create) compared to existing interactive systems. (introduction and literature review)

SOFTWARE SPECS - 
✓ Describe all the hardware parts and software components you have and why you need them all.
Elaborate this section of your document by details on your circuit diagram, how you put all your
electronic parts together, which online resources or existing code you elaborated to build your
project, which parts you had to design from scratch. Please keep in mind less is more. You don’t
need to add too much complexity.

INTERACTION -                                                                               
✓ Discuss your mapping strategies, sonic components, range and magnitude of your parameters.
Ideally draw a table or diagram that shows each interaction and the related sound parameter.
(mapping)
✓ Describe a use case of how a user can interact with your instruments and what are the possible
outcomes. (use case)
                                                                              
FINAL THOUGHTS -                                                                               
✓ Summarize your ideas, including what questions/problems were answered, what you learnt,
what is still unresolved, and what new or refined questions/problems you discovered from your
project and if and how you would continue this project in the future and if you are planning to
expand it. (conclusion)
